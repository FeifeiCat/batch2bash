[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
           Given a working, syntaticly and semanticly correct(!) batch file it
       produces a bash file. Only exception are some weird  goto  jumps  which
       you should avoid in general.
           You  still  need to make the output file executable if that is your
       intention.
